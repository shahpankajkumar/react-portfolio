       I developed the Donation Marketing Cloud (DMC), a comprehensive donation management system designed to meet client-specific needs. This system allows users to create templates and design forms using an integrated editor, enhancing the flexibility and customization of donation campaigns. The frontend is built with React.js, leveraging Material UI, Ant Design, Bootstrap, CSS, and SCSS for a polished and responsive user interface. On the backend, Node.js ensures robust server-side functionality. The application utilizes various AWS services to provide scalable and efficient solutions, including AWS RDS for relational database management, DynamoDB for NoSQL data storage, Lambda for serverless computing, Glue for ETL processes, EC2 for scalable compute capacity, Athena for querying data, and S3 for storage. This combination of technologies and services ensures a reliable, high-performance platform for managing donations effectively.
